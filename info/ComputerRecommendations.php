                    <h2>Computer Recommendations</h2>
                    <h3>What You Need to Connect to ResNet</h3>
                    <p>
                Your computer will need an Ethernet adapter and an Ethernet cable.
                Most newer computers come with Ethernet adapters built-in, but you will most likely need to purchase an Ethernet cable.
                        <strong>A phone cable will not work.</strong>

                The <a href="http://bookstore.missouristate.edu" title="Missouri State Bookstore">Missouri State Bookstore</a> sells Ethernet adapters and cables if you do not already have one.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Laptop or Desktop?</h3>

                    <p>Both laptops and desktop computers have their advantages and disadvantages.
                Primary factors in the decision to purchase one or the other usually include price, performance, and the ability to upgrade them.
                Laptops are nearly always more expensive, and are, for the most part, not upgradeable (meaning you'll never have more than what you initially buy).
                However, laptops offer mobility, take up less space, use less power, and can access the <a href="/Help/Wireless/" title="Wirless Information">wireless network</a> without purchasing additional equipment upgrades.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Desktop computers take up more space and use more power, but they are less expensive in relation to their performance and are easier to upgrade, meaning their lifespan is longer.
                  Additionally, desktop computer hardware can usually be worked on by the professionals at the ResNet office, whereas laptops are more likely to require being sent back to the manufacturer or a specialist to be worked on. </p>

                        <h3>Recommended Accessories</h3>

                        <strong>USB Flash Drive</strong>

                        <br />
                            A flash drive will allow a student to both store their digital documents and carry them to class or meetings.
                            They are small, reliable, relatively inexpensive, and allow a student to always have their important papers on them, even when they are nowhere near their computer.
                        <br /><br /><strong>Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) or Battery Backup</strong>
                        <br />
                            A UPS serves two useful purposes.
                            First, it acts as a surge protector that will prevent any extra voltage from going through a computer and harming the more sensitive components.
                            Secondly, if the power goes down for a short period, the battery inside the UPS will continue to power the computer, allowing documents to be saved and the computer to be shut down properly.
                            The amount of time the computer will stay running depends on the UPS's rating and how many devices are drawing power from it.
                        <h3>Educational Discounts</h3>

                            When making hardware and software purchases, be sure to ask if there are educational discounts for students.
                            Many companies offer special pricing for students that can add up to big savings.
                            For example, both Dell and Apple offer discounts via the links provided below.
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="http://helpdesk.missouristate.edu/hardware-for-home.htm">Dell</a></li>

                            <li><a href="http://helpdesk.missouristate.edu/hardware-for-home.htm">Apple</a> (You will need to select Missouri State)</li>
