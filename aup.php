			<h2>ResNet Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
				<p class = "paragraph">
					Missouri State University provides access to the campus network in residence hall living units. 
					This privilege is assisted by funds from not-for-profit organizations (MOREnet), and is meant to 
  					be used equitably and fairly by all to assist students, faculty, and staff in fulfilling the academic programs of Missouri State University. 
					In no way can Missouri State network resources be used for commercial gain.
				</p>
                <p class = "paragraph">
					The Computer Services Department maintains the network through its <a href="http://networking.missouristate.edu">Networking Services</a> division, 
                    and has developed many policies and procedures to facilitate the equitable use of this valuable resource. 
					These policies are available at <a href="http://www.missouristate.edu/ais/itpolicies.htm">http://www.missouristate.edu/ais/itpolicies.htm</a>.
					ResNet's acceptable use policy is meant to supplement not supplant these policies and procedures. 
					It is Residence Life, Housing and Dining Services&#8217; expectation that students familiarize themselves with and abide by Computer Services policies and procedures 
                    as well as all local, state, and federal law.
				</p>
			    <p class = "paragraph">
					In addition to these policies, Residence Life, Housing and Dining Services has additional expectations to help us all be better stewards of networking bandwidth.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p class = "answer">
							Transferring of copyrighted materials is<strong> STRICTLY</strong> prohibited.
							Should a student sharing copyrighted material be reported to ResNet, and the student's illegal activity be confirmed, the student will be notified 
                            of the infraction and asked promptly to rectify the situation. 
							A record will be made of the infraction and the student will be submitted to student conduct for further action. 
							Multiple infractions may lead to termination of students&#8217; access privileges.
						</p>
				   </li>
          		  <li>
					<p class = "answer">
						The use of routers, gateways, hubs, switches or bridges when connected to Missouri State&#8217;s Ethernet jacks is prohibited without prior approval. 
						This includes wireless devices, such as Bluetooth, 802.11 devices and Apple's airports. 
						Approval is limited to academic necessity, and then only routers. 
						Since ample jacks are provided to students, approval is HIGHLY unlikely. 
						Students may use routers set up privately without connection to the school's network for any reason. 
						In no instance may wireless devices be used as they interfere with school resources by operating in an unregulated frequency range.
					</p>

				</li>
                <li>
					<p class = "answer">
						Students are expected to be proactive in virus protection efforts. 
						To assist students, Residence Life will provide assistance in locating a free antivirus program to use while you reside in a residence hall. 
						In addition to anti-virus software, students should make sure they adequately patch their software and operating systems for security holes.
					</p>
				</li>
                <li>
					<p class = "answer">
						Students are expected to refrain from attempting to access any resources on the network that they do not have prior explicit permission to use. 
						This includes, but is not limited to, "browsing" the network to see if there are open shares on the network.
					</p>
				</li>
                <li>
					<p class = "answer">
						Students are expected to be responsible for their own machines and computer accounts. 
						You are not to share computer accounts with	anyone and are strictly responsible for any action taken by others using your machine. 
						While not a frequent occurrence, people with malevolent intentions will attempt to use others to try and deflect attention from themselves. 
						Users should not allow themselves to become victims.
					</p>
				</li>
                <li>
					<p class = "answer">
						Students should be aware of the software they use and the configuration of their computers. 
						Advance operating systems and networking software can be complicated programs with many "security" holes. 
						Students should spend time learning how to properly use the software they download and the operating systems they use.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			Violation of any of the policies covering the use of computers and the campus network may result in the immediate deactivation of your Ethernet jack until the situation is 
            resolved. Serious offenders risk permanent shutdown, referral to the student conduct system and/or criminal prosecution.
