				All students that live in the residence halls can now only connect to the <i>ResNet</i> access points. 
				This means that all students in the residence halls will have only one configuration to set up, rather than two.
				As in previous semesters, wireless activity that occurs outside of the residence halls will not count against the bandwidth quota.
				For more information about wireless and tutorials for setting up your devices, please see our <a href="/wireless/index.php">wireless page</a>.

				<p class="paragraph"><strong>Bandwidth Expansion Success</strong> -- Yesterday the bandwidth split occurred.  
				There were some brief outages during the transition, but now everything appears to be working as expected.
				In fact, if you'd like an idea as to the speed we are getting through the pipe, check out this <a href="images/posts/SpeedTestSpringNet.png">screenshot</a> from Speedtest.
				Please note that there were few students on campus and that the test node was in close proximity to the University.
				This screenshot is simply an indication of what is possible on the new connection.
