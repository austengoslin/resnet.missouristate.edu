                <h3>What are the different wireless networks on campus?</h3>

                <p class="answer">
                            "MSU ResNet" is for students who live in the resident halls. "MSU" is for students who live off-campus.
                            "MSU Sponsored" is for approved guests of the University, such as companies and organizations that are visiting the University.

                    <h3>What devices can and cannot connect to our wireless networks?</h3>

                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                            Phones and tablets can connect to our wireless networks. Game consoles, such as the Xbox 360, Xbox One, PSP, PS3, PS4, and any Nintendo portables, and smart TVs
                            do not support the encryption used in our wireless networks and connect to our wireless networks. However, devices such as game consoles and smart TVs can connect to our wired network.
                </p>

                <h3>How do I connect to the Internet wirelessly with my device?</h3>

                <p class="answer">
                            To connect to any wireless network on campus you will need your BearPass user name
                            and Bearpass password. Click <a href="/wireless/" title="Wireless Access"> here</a> for more information.

                <h3>How do the Ethernet jacks located in each of the residence hall rooms work?</h3>

                <p class="answer">
                            There is an orange jack and a white jack on the wall. The orange jack is the network data port and the white jack is the telephone port.
                            To activate the network port you will have to register yourself to the port by using our port registration system called ResReg.

                <h3>Is there a way to get internet access on my game system or smart tv?</h3>

                <p class="answer">
                            Yes. If the device has an Ethernet port, it can get Internet access.

                                                                <p class='answer'>

                                                                    Your computer must be registered at the <a href="http://resreg.missouristate.edu" title="Registration">Registration</a> website before complete access to the internet is granted.

                <h3>What happens if I change rooms or halls after registering my computer?</h3>

                <p class="answer">
                            Registration ties your computer to a specific jack in your room.
                            Once registered your computer will only work in the registered jack and the jack will only work with your computer.
                            Therefore, before moving, you will need to unregister your computer (in your old room) by going to the &quot;edit port&quot; function and select &quot;remove port.&quot;
                            After moving, you will need to register your computer (in your new room) as usual.
                            Both functions can be achieved from the <a href="http://resreg.missouristate.edu" title="Registration">Registration</a> website.

                                                                    dial-up. Additionally, you will be unable to connect to the wireless network while in penalty. 
                                                                    Your connection will remain in this state until enough of your previous traffic drops off to bring your total usage below the limit. 
                                                                    Be aware that continued excessive traffic can potentially be enough to keep you in penalty.

                <h3>What is the cost to print to the front desk printers? </h3>

                <p class="answer">
                            Residence hall students can print for free, but there is a limit of 350 pages per semester. Each resident receives 350 pages each semester, however pages do not roll over to the next semester.
							If you have exhausted your print quota, you can purchase more at Hammons 104. Five dollars will give you 100 additional page. Also there is a cap of 25 pages per print job and the print job can't exceed 10 megabytes.
                            More information about the print quota can be found on the <a href="/info/print.php" title="Print Quota">print quota</a> page of this site.

                <h3>Can I use my residence hall's front desk laser printer from my room?</h3>

                <p class="answer">

                <h3>What is a bandwidth quota system?</h3>

                <p class="answer">
                            The <a href="/info/bandwidth.php" title="Bandwidth">bandwidth</a> quota system is a preset limit (in bytes) for downloads and uploads over the internet (but not local content).
                            The limit is more than conducive for normal internet usage and is meant to keep the network functioning at its highest potential throughout the school year.
                            The bandwidth quota operates on a rolling seven day system, meaning that traffic conducted seven days ago drops off at midnight each night.
                            The cap is 200 gigabytes combined upload and download.

                <h3>Why would I lose my network connection?  How do I get it back? </h3>

                <p class="answer">
                            If your use of network resources negatively impacts others, Networking Services may have your network port shut off without prior warning.
                            This may happen for a number of reasons including: virus activity, improperly configured system or program, unusual or disruptive network behavior,
                            or an outside source filing a complaint against your computer.
                            A complaint could have been filed for reasons that include, but are not limited to, copyright infringement with Peer-to-Peer file sharing,
                            port-scanning, and e-mail viruses(for more information regarding copyright complaints, please see
                    <a href="/info/copyright.php" title="Copyright">our copyright page</a> for more information).
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                            If you lose your connection, please contact ResNet at (417)836-6100 so a technician can guide you through the necessary steps to be restored to the network.
                            Also, if you have lost the ability to connect to the wireless network, you may want to check <a href="http://resreg.missouristate.edu" title="ResReg">  http://resreg.missouristate.edu</a> to see if you've exceeded your bandwidth quota.

                            Yes.
                            Automatically updated anti-virus software is required for all computers connected to the residence hall network.
